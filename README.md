# mern_dev_kit

This is a kit that allows you to start working on your MERN application right away, wihtout much complication, it includes mongodb configuration, as well as gulp file configuration, with browsersync. In short terms, hot reload is activated.

## Steps

1. **Download / Pull or Clone this Repo in your computer**

2. **Install Node in your computer**

3. **Once the repo is in your computer, install all the node packeges:**
```
npm install
```

4. **Start the development server:***
```
npm run development
```
5. **Open a new terminal, and run gulp:**
```
gulp
```

## Notes/ To Do:

1. Still I have to finish the production part, meaning image, and code optimization for production.

2. We could run gulp and npm command together in one console, but I like to have it separate just for debugging.
